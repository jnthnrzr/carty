A responsive minimalist app where entries can be added or removed. Transitions and smooth animations supplement the responsive design of the frontend.

```

## Installation

1. Install dependencies with npm

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the dev server, which starts the React client and Express server concurrently

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser and interact with the React frontend for the shopping list.

4. Postman can be used to make HTTP requests directly to the server url `http://localhost:5000/api/items`.
